# Hackathon_xto10x: Airline Profitability Prediction using Machine Learning

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict airline profitability by analyzing various factors such as flight delays, operational costs, and seasonal variations. By leveraging machine learning, we provide actionable insights to optimize operations and improve overall profitability.

# ðŸš€ Key Features & Technologies

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gather Data: Collect flight data with all necessary features.
- Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data using statistical techniques.
- Scaling: Standardize numerical features for better model performance.
- Outlier Detection: Use IQR or other methods to handle anomalies in the data.
