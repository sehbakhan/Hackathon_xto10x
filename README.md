# Hackathon_xto10x: Airline Profitability Prediction using Machine Learning

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict airline profitability by analyzing various factors, such as flight delays, operational costs, and seasonal variations. By leveraging machine learning, we provide actionable insights to optimize operations and improve overall profitability.

# ðŸš€ Key Features & Technologies

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gather Data: Collect flight data with all necessary features.
- Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data using statistical techniques.
- Scaling: Standardize numerical features for better model performance.
- Outlier Detection: Use IQR or other methods to handle anomalies in the data.

### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between features and profitability.
- Seasonality Trends: Examine how flight profits fluctuate by time of year, day of week, etc.
- Feature Importance: Use correlation matrices and feature selection techniques to focus on the most impactful variables.
- Visualization: Use Power BI, Matplotlib, or Seaborn to visualize patterns.

### 3.Model Selection & Training
- Baseline Models: Start with Linear Regression and Decision Trees for benchmarking.
- Advanced Models:
-- Random Forest
-- XGBoost
-- Gradient Boosting
-- Decision Tree Regressor
-- Cross-Validation: Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.




### 4. Model Explainability & Interpretability
- SHAP Values: Identify the most influential features affecting profitability.
- Feature Importance Scores: Use tree-based models to rank important factors.
- Partial Dependence Plots: Show how specific features influence predictions.

### 5.Actionable Insights & Optimization
- Scenario Analysis: Test how different operational strategies affect profitability.
- Business Recommendations: Provide optimization strategies based on model insights.
